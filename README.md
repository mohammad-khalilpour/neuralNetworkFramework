# Neural Network Framework
A minimalistic neural network framework developed for the Computational Intelligence course project at Amirkabir University Of Technology.

## Overview
This project implements a basic neural network framework in Python. It's designed for simplicity, making it suitable for educational purposes and introductory projects.


## Quick Start
1. Clone the Repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/mohammad-khalilpour/neuralNetworkFramework.git
cd neuralNetworkFramework
```
2. Test the Framework:

The project includes three code snippets to test the framework:

One Neuron Training \
One Layer Training \
Fully Connected MNIST Training 


Adjust and use these snippets to experiment with the framework.

## Implemented Features

### Activation Functions

- **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) (relu)**
- **Sigmoid (sigmoid)**
- **Leaky ReLU (leaky_relu)**
- **Softmax (softmax)**


### Loss Functions

- **Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss (categorical_cross_entropy)**
- **Mean Squared Error Loss (mean_squared_error)**

### Optimizers

- **Adam (AdamOptimizer)**
- **Momentum (MomentumOptimizer)**
- **RMSprop (RMSpropOptimizer)**
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) (SGDOptimizer)**
